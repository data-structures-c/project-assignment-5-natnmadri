CS 20 A - Data StructuresSort AlgorithmsAccording to the data, Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort had the longest runtimes. Bubble Sort had the longest runtime with varying times depending on the type of arrays. Insertion sort had the highest standard deviation, since its runtime varied drastically compared to the type of array that was being sorted. There was about a 6 second delay in the data. It took less time sorting algorithms with mutations of 2 , 5, and 10, as opposed to the random array and the incorrect order array. Insertion would be the second fastest depending on the type of data it was sorting. Selection Sort and Merge Sort had the closest standard deviations of less than a second. It is obvious that Merge Sort had the fastest run time, no matter the type of data that it was sorting. I would say that Selection Sort appeared to have more of an “average” run time, it was in the range of about 11 seconds, but consistent in all types of data. Bubble Sort does not appear to be that efficient, and Merge Sort is the most efficient of these four sorting algorithms.
